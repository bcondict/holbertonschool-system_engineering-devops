#### What is the advantage of using "#!/usr/bin/env bash" over "#!/bin/bash"
The #!/usr/bin/env bash shebang offers more portability because we donâ€™t have to write the absolute path to an interpreter.

| #!/usr/bin/bash | #!/usr/bin/env bash |
--------------------
| Offers more security | Offers more portability |
| More specific, since we have to declare the exact path to an interpreter | Automatically searches for the first occurrence
of an interpreter in the environment |
| Can support extra parameters passed after the declaration of the interpreter | Cannot support extra parameters because the system reads them as a single command |
